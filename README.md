PDFio is a simple C library for reading and writing PDF files.  The primary
goals of PDFio are:

- Read and write any version of PDF file
- Provide access to pages, objects, and streams within a PDF file
- Support reading and writing of encrypted PDF files
- Extract or embed useful metadata (author, creator, page information, etc.)
- "Filter" PDF files, for example to extract a range of pages or to embed fonts
  that are missing from a PDF
- Provide access to objects used for each page

PDFio is *not* concerned with rendering or viewing a PDF file, although a PDF
RIP or viewer could be written using it.


Requirements
------------

PDFio requires the following to build the software:

- A C99 compiler such as Clang, GCC, or MS Visual C
- A POSIX-compliant `make` program
- ZLIB (<https://www.zlib.net>) 1.1 or higher

IDE files for Xcode (macOS/iOS) and Visual Studio (Windows) are also provided.


Documentation
-------------

See the man page (`pdfio.3`) and full HTML documentation (`pdfio.html`) for
information on using PDFio.


Installing PDFio
----------------

PDFio uses a configure script on Unix systems to generate a makefile:

    ./configure

If you want a shared library, run:

    ./configure --enable-shared

The default installation location is "/usr/local".  Pass the `--prefix` option
to make to install it to another location:

    ./configure --prefix=/some/other/directory

Once configured, run the following to make the library:

    make all

To test it, run:

    make test

To install it, run:

    sudo make install

Building for WASI/Wasm
-----------------

Wasm only support static libraries

    AR=/opt/wasi-sdk/bin/ar CC=/opt/wasi-sdk/bin/clang CFLAGS="-O2" ./configure --host=wasm32-wasi

    make libpdfio.a

Visual Studio Project
---------------------

The Visual Studio solution ("pdfio.sln") is provided for Windows developers and
generates the PDFIO1 DLL.  You can also use NuGet to install the `pdfio_native`
package.


Xcode Project
-------------

There is also an Xcode project ("pdfio.xcodeproj") you can use on macOS which
generates a static library that will be installed under "/usr/local" with:

    sudo xcodebuild install
